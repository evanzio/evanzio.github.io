<h1>Welcome to to custom sticky header example</h1>

<p>I am using waypoints for a custom sticky header/nav example</p>

<h2>Functional Spec:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Header should stick to bottom of client window when landing on page.</li>
<li>When scrolling down, the header should remain fixed.</li>
<li>Once first image has become fully visible, header should stop sticking to the bottom and continue moving with the scroll.</li>
<li>Once the header hits the top of client viewport it will then stick to the top.</li>
</ul>
